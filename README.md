# Firebase-CDN
A CDN library for use with Firebase V9
â€‹
I had a hard time figuring out how to use firebase V9. I used the compat SDK, which was a temporary solution.
I knew, that at some time I had to use the regular SDK, but couldn't figure out how to use it. 
It could be that I was new to JavaScript and didn't understand the export, import and modules thing.
I want to use plain/vanilla JavaScript, so no framework like React, Vue, Angular or jQuery.
I felt like the documentation told how to drive the car, but did not tell the traffic regulations.
I spent like the 4 times 4 hours on trying to upgrade to the V9 SDK with no success.
The fifth time is is the charm.
